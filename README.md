### Example : randomMoves()

Uses **mon10.getXY()**, **mon10.moveXYD()**, **mon10.nonzero()** and **mon10.size()** to make entirely random moves with almost no chance of solving a puzzle.

Script: [mon10-codeplay-example-random-moves.js](https://github.com/madeofnumbers/10-codeplay/blob/main/examples/random-moves/mon10-codeplay-example-random-moves.js)
